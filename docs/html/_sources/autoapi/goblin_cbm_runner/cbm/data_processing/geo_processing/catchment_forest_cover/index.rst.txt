   Catchment Forest Cover Module
   ==============================

   This module provides functionalities to analyze and process forest cover data within specific catchments.
   It leverages external API services to fetch the required data and applies various data processing techniques
   to filter, aggregate, and present the catchment forest data in a structured format.

   Classes:
       CatchmentForest: Manages the retrieval and transformation of forest cover data for catchments.

   Dependencies:
       catchment_data_api.catchment_data_api.CatchmentDataAPI: External API service class for fetching catchment data.
       pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.

.. py:class:: CatchmentForest


   A class to manage and process forest cover data for given catchment areas.

   .. attribute:: api

      An instance of the CatchmentDataAPI class for accessing catchment data.

      :type: CatchmentDataAPI

   .. method:: get_catchment_forest(catchment)

      
      Retrieves and processes forest cover data for a specified catchment area.
      

   .. py:method:: get_catchment_forest(catchment)

      Retrieves and processes forest cover data for a specified catchment area.

      This method fetches raw forest cover data using the CatchmentDataAPI, filters the data
      for specific forest types, applies mappings for cover and soil types, and aggregates the
      data by catchment, forest type, and soil type. The resulting data is then pivoted to present
      soil types as columns, providing a structured view of the total hectares covered by each
      forest type and soil type within the catchment.

      :param catchment: The name of the catchment area for which forest cover data is to be retrieved.
      :type catchment: str

      :returns: A DataFrame containing aggregated forest cover data for the specified catchment,
                structured by forest species, with columns for different soil types and their corresponding
                total hectares.
      :rtype: pandas.DataFrame
