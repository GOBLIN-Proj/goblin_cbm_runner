.. py:class:: ForestStand(species, yield_class, soil, area, age=0)


   Represents a single forest stand.

   .. attribute:: species

      The species of the forest stand.

      :type: str

   .. attribute:: yield_class

      The yield class of the forest stand, indicating its productivity.

      :type: int

   .. attribute:: soil

      The type of soil in the forest stand, affecting growth conditions.

      :type: str

   .. attribute:: area

      The area of the forest stand in hectares.

      :type: float

   .. attribute:: age

      The age of the forest stand in years, starting at 0.

      :type: int, optional

   .. attribute:: since_last_dist

      The number of years since the last disturbance, initially None.

      :type: int, optional

   .. method:: __init__(self, species, yield_class, soil, area, age=0)

      Initializes a new instance of the ForestStand class.

   .. method:: age_stand(self)

      Increments the age of the forest stand by one year.

   .. method:: disturb(self)

      Records a disturbance event by setting or incrementing the 'since_last_dist' attribute.

   .. method:: reset_dist(self)

      Resets the time since the last disturbance to zero.
      

   .. py:method:: age_stand()

      Increases the age of the stand by one year.


   .. py:method:: disturb()

      Increases time since last disturbance by one year.


   .. py:method:: reset_dist()

      Resets time since last disturbance to zero.



.. py:class:: DisturbedForestStand(year, species, yield_class, soil)


   Represents a disturbed forest stand.

   .. attribute:: year

      The year of the stand.

      :type: int

   .. attribute:: species

      The species of the stand.

      :type: str

   .. attribute:: yield_class

      The yield class of the stand.

      :type: str

   .. attribute:: soil

      The soil type of the stand.

      :type: str

   .. attribute:: dist

      The disturbance of the stand (default is None).

      :type: None

   .. attribute:: area

      The area of the stand (default is None).

      :type: None


.. py:class:: AfforestationTracker


   A tracker for managing afforestation and forest disturbance events.

   This class is used to track and manage forest stands and disturbances over time in
   a forest simulation context. It keeps track of various stands of forest, their characteristics,
   and disturbances that occur.

   It also resets the forest age when a harvest event has taken place.

   .. attribute:: loader_class

      An instance of the Loader class.

      :type: Loader

   .. attribute:: data_manager_class

      An instance of the DataManager class.

      :type: DataManager

   .. attribute:: disturbance_timing

      A DataFrame containing disturbance timing information.

      :type: DataFrame

   .. attribute:: stands

      A list of ForestStand objects representing current forest stands.

      :type: list

   .. attribute:: disturbed_stands

      A list of DisturbedForestStand objects representing disturbed forest stands.

      :type: list

   .. method:: afforest(area, species, yield_class, soil, age=0)

      Adds a new afforestation event.

   .. method:: move_to_next_age()

      Ages all stands by one year.

   .. method:: forest_disturbance(year, species, yield_class, soil, proportion)

      Adds a disturbance event.

   .. method:: get_stand_data_for_year()

      Returns data for current stands.

   .. method:: get_disturbance_data_for_year()

      Returns data for disturbed stands.

   .. method:: get_stand_data_by_age()

      Returns a nested dictionary with stand areas grouped by age, species, and yield class.
      

   .. py:method:: afforest(area, species, yield_class, soil, age=0)

      Add an afforestation event to the tracker.


   .. py:method:: move_to_next_age()

      Age all stands by one year.


   .. py:method:: forest_disturbance(year, species, yield_class, soil, proportion)

      Add a disturbance event to the tracker.


   .. py:method:: get_stand_data_for_year()

      Returns a list of tuples containing stand data for the current year.


   .. py:method:: get_disturbance_data_for_year()

      Returns a list of tuples containing disturbance data for the current year.


   .. py:method:: get_stand_data_by_age()

      Returns a nested dictionary with areas grouped by age, species, and yield class.
